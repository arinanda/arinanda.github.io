I"1<p>I can remember about 4 years ago, I started to make HTML templates for ThemeForest. Unfortunately, I failed to pass the quality stage and I was not getting enough feedback from them. I was getting a general sentence saying that my item is not ready yet and the design quality is not unique enough.</p>
